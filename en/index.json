The game is designed as an RPG quiz type that allows children to interact and pass levels. The game is mainly guided by a character named “Old House Elf” who leads the children through the game. The storybook tells the story of an old house located in the Fu-Kuo Municipal Kindergarten in Chiayi. It used to be the residence of the first principal, but after the principal retired, the Old House Elf fell asleep. Later, the children of the kindergarten cleaned up the old house and woke up the Old House Elf. The game then introduces the stories of six other old houses located in Chiayi, which will be presented to children through the gameplay. The Old House Elf will ask the children to collect some items from the other five old houses to help him renovate his shabby room. In each old house, the children will encounter a different elf and find various hints about the old house. By answering questions, they can obtain the items the Old House Elf needs. Once all the items from the five old houses are collected, the children return to the Fu-Kuo Municipal Kindergarten to deliver the items to the Old House Elf, and the game is cleared. Here are the six old buildings that will be introduced in the game 🏠 : 🏠 The old house in Fu Guo Kindergarten, Chiayi City: This is the dormitory of the first principal and will also be the character that leads children to play in the game. In the game, it will be personified as an elf called “Old House” and will allow children to become familiar with the following old houses. 🏠 “Historical Data Museum” in Chiayi Park: This 78-year-old old house is made of cypress wood and displays many stories from the past of Chiayi. Previously, the Historical Data Museum was a building attached to the Chiayi Shrine during the Japanese occupation, and it was also used as the 828 Army Hospital. Therefore, there are also photos of soldiers receiving medical treatment here. 🏠 Chiayi City Art Museum: This 85-year-old building has many circular windows and is a combination of Chinese and Western architectural styles. It used to be the Chiayi branch of the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation before it was renovated into an art museum. Many artworks are exhibited here. 🏠 “East Gate Church” near the school: This 87-year-old Japanese-style building is made entirely of cypress wood. It is the only remaining building and shrine of Tenrikyo in Taiwan after the restoration of Taiwan. People come here to pray for peace. 🏠 Tainan Cafe: This 96-year-old building has many small rooms. It used to be a maternity hospital, and each of these small rooms was a delivery room in the past. There are many beautiful tiles on the wall at the entrance of the Tainan Cafe, called “flower tiles.” They are a precious set of six-piece jigsaw flower tiles that need to be carefully protected. 🏠 Cypress Living Village: This is the largest and most complete preserved old house group in Taiwan, with a total of 31 old houses. The oldest one is 107 years old, and the houses are mainly covered with red cypress and Fuzhou pine. It used to be the residence of Japanese officials, but now it has been transformed into a forest-themed cultural and creative park by the Forestry Bureau. It is very lively and has become a famous new landmark. \r\r ","date":"2023-03-13","objectID":"/en/rpg-game-introduce/:5:0","tags":["Fukoo Kindergarten - Old House Adventure"],"title":"Fukoo Kindergarten - Old House Adventure | Game Introduction","uri":"/en/rpg-game-introduce/"},{"categories":null,"content":"About FuGuo Kindergarten - Old House Adventure","date":"2023-03-14","objectID":"/en/about/","tags":null,"title":"About FuGuo Kindergarten - Old House Adventure","uri":"/en/about/"},{"categories":null,"content":" “FuGuo Kindergarten - Old House Adventure” is an adventure game that introduces several old houses near the FuGuo Kindergarten in the form of a game.
